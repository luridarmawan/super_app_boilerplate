# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - .env
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/logo/
    - assets/images/banners/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

# Flutter Native Splash Configuration
# Jalankan: dart run flutter_native_splash:create
# 
# SMOOTH TRANSITION STRATEGY:
# 1. Native splash tampil instan dengan warna solid
# 2. Flutter splash muncul dengan fade-in dari warna yang sama
# 3. Background dinamis (dari AppInfo.splashBackground) dimuat
# 4. Transisi smooth ke main app
flutter_native_splash:
  # Warna background - sama dengan colorScheme.primary untuk seamless transition
  color: "#1565C0"
  
  # Gambar logo di tengah splash screen
  image: assets/images/logo/carik_blue_logo.png
  
  # Opsi untuk branding image di bagian bawah (opsional)
  # branding: assets/images/branding.png
  # branding_mode: bottom
  
  # Background image full screen (opsional, jika ingin pakai gambar penuh)
  # Tidak digunakan karena kita pakai dynamic image dari Flutter splash
  # background_image: assets/images/splash_background.png
  
  # Dark mode settings - matching dark theme primary color
  color_dark: "#0D47A1"
  image_dark: assets/images/logo/carik_blue_logo.png
  
  # Android specific
  android: true
  android_12:
    # Warna background untuk Android 12+
    color: "#1565C0"

    image: assets/images/logo/carik_blue_logo.png

    # Icon background (opsional)
    # icon_background_color: "#FFFFFF"
    # icon_background_color_dark: "#1a1a2e"
  
  # iOS specific
  ios: true
  
  # Web specific
